<h3>First doucumentation - 16/12/2015</h3>
<h1>Documentation of the work on the Lottery Program</h1>
fron new to old.
The excution of all that documented here is at the source file : LotteryNumberDraft.java - see there. 


<h2>main brief-where we stand</h2>
Brief to the next time : 
-Last time – we almost done the mission : 2 – how to choose random number from a range. &– How to do random choosing from specific list. 
The code snippets is at the draft class at the project library. 
your next mission is : 
1-to do a method (overloaded) method "choose from list"  that get parameter of arrayList. 
2-To study about what happen when U deleting an element at list, and how to squeeze it. 
3- all what U wrote at the draft:
1) Sharp it , with proper accsessing and modifiers, good naming, good implementation (The more u can do it flexible with utility to get the data from outside – better). 
2)Then -  take to formal class, and do to it  a proper test . For using at the future. 
after u done all – u can continue…
 

goodbye.





little TODO
 16/12/15 ,5 on Tevet 5775 (jewish count)

Main task : - define method :
1.1+arratList listNumbers(int  startRange, int endRange).
return all the number that at the range.
1.2+overLoaded listNumbers(int… singleNumbers) 
return all the single numbers that inside.

1 –How to define random choosing manually.  – not for now!!
2 – how to choose random number from a range. &– How to do random choosing from specific list
3- make 1.1
4 – make 1.2

General Issues :
- all the method still at the draft and not sharpness. take care of them before continuing to the next step. 



full todo:  (create at: 16/12/15 ,5 on Tevet 5775 (jewish count))
1- define method :
1.1+arratList listNumbers(int  startRange, int endRange).
return all the number that at the range.
1.2+overLoaded listNumbers(int… singleNumbers)
return all the single numbers that inside.

2- 
2.1-+arrayList excludeNumbers(ArrayList list ,int startRange, int endRange)
thast exclude the numbers at range (include the pars)and return the list.
2.2- + arrayList excludeNumbers(arrayList list, int …singleNumbers)
thast exclude all  the single  numbers and return the list.
3. +arrayList addList(arrayList list, arrayList newList)
 that add the new to the list and return it. (maybe already defined at the java library )
4. define
+void lotteryProgramExcute()
that excute properly all the above in logic way and by the example.(or similar).
5. releasing the code, (upload) thinking about next testing and and improving.

So – as u can see I have done a full (relatively) TODO objects. now it's the time to excute it. My methodology will be to make a little TODO to every main TODO. The old TODo that I wiil finish and delete, will pass on to old todo(or some else name that I will choose. 
As I said. Me too love order and organization. But from other side it's many details and I want the work will flow. So I get my way between that.
For the order – the little TODO always be Up the document and the full todo below it. 
Ok , so now I think – how to do by myself random chhosing. Is it possibe? I don’t found something that I can do by myself.
