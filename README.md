# EulerRandomProject
This is the first project that I represent in public. I will glad if someone will look and will give me feedback.

I have already started to make the project, few days ago so I post what I already write and did. 


15/12/15 ,3 on Tevet 5775 (jewish count)
So, with the help of my God, it's my first documented and public project. I have much to say but not now…


My knowldege at Java is mainly at those subjects : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/certification/javase-7-programmer1.html
tht's was my mainly preperation, and in adittion ,typically, with more topics, among the rest – HTML, CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT, WEB-SERVICE .and more…
I know that some maybe will laugh or talk down , but "In God We Trust", and I don't see them at all, this is maybe for novices, or even that not, but I am glad and have passion and I gonna take my ride, agree or not. 

So I have some Basic Issues that I must present,like desktop application, web application, websites, and more, and realy since 2014 I am programming and studing,  and do many things but still nothing has uploaded and have showed to the world. So now it's the time.


So for my first project I will take one of my love missions of "project Euler", for thos that not familiar this is a site that present math questions, but U can solve the problems(normally) by program. U check your solution, and u get V just if it correct. U can see here (u Must sign in for enjoying from those features).  https://projecteuler.net/archives


Not need to say,and like them asked at the site. that I don't want to disturb others that want to solve it, it's just for represent my utilities, and who want to enjoy those problem- should not use my codes…

Since I have solved more that few question so I gonna pick randomaly one that I yet solve, or started to solve, up to 40 (I believe that more high it's more complicated. 


<h1>SO… HERE WE GO!!!</h1>

<h4>THE PROJECTS: EULER ?
PROJECT TARGET: To solve one of the problems of project euler, that I yet solve, up to problem 40. by JAVA.</h4>

General mission and requirements:
1 – Choose by random choose programs problem to solve.
2- solve it.
3- the solution will be with opportunity to the user to fill manually the variables. not hardcoded. 
* At the future another ideas – so put it as web-site, mobie app, desktop application…

Getting  Started

So I don't want to work "Over planned" ,I have tried it once and it was too heavy. I am a natural planned man, so I want to flow…. I will do with every step some TODO. And we will see how it's will go…


-So the first mission is typically to choose a problem. 
- My strategy will be to write a TODO from "UP" (the top level) to see the next 3-4 mission and than starting to solve it from inside. Analyzing will be through motion(Of how do it in the core programming – static/instance, what variables etc…)


<h1>TODO (from UP)</h1>

1- make sure what problem u have done(see picture 1), or started to solve. -DONE
2-create a program that will pick one. 
3- understand the problem. 

inside TODO

1-make sure what problem u have done(see picture 1), or started to solve:
-As can be seem from the picture I have done problems: 1-9, 17,18,23. At my IDE I see that I worked also on 10,11,19. so all this problems I don't want. 
1-9,10,11,17,18,19,23. 
1-DONE
This step was for let me know what problems(from euler) I want to skip and not choose. 

2-create a program that will pick one. 
-After that now will be mission inside mission. I want to create a lottery program (the target is desktop application) that 
will help the user to choose random values, from specific ranges by his need. 

so I will continue with this mission at ... . See there please.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The main Goals of the Project is:
To make a program that let tools to answer one of the project-euler problems,that will choose randomaly 
from 1-40, exclude the above mentioned problems. 
The creating will be by java.


<h3>the main mission for get the target is :
ToDo
1- Friendly Lottery-Program for choosen randomaly the problem.
2- Make the program for answer.
