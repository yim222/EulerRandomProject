# EulerRandomProject
This is the first project that I represent in public. I will glad if someone will look and will give me feedback.

I have already started to make the project, few days ago so I post what I already write and did.

So, with the help of my God, it's my first documented and public project. I have much to say but not now…


My knowldege at Java is mainly at those subjects : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/certification/javase-7-programmer1.html
tht's was my mainly preperation, and in adittion ,typically, with more topics, among the rest – HTML, CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT, WEB-SERVICE .and more…
I know that some maybe will laugh or talk down , but "In God We Trust", and I don't see them at all, this is maybe for novices, or even that not, but I am glad and have passion and I gonna take my ride, agree or not. 

So I have some Basic Issues that I must present,like desktop application, web application, websites, and more, and realy since 2014 I am programming and studing,  and do many things but still nothing has uploaded and have showed to the world. So now it's the <h1>time.</h1>
